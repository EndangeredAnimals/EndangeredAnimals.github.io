                            will encourage kids and these kids will want to save us (the endangered animals). We also
                            hope that these kids/ our readers can change the world! In this website there will be a
                            combination of many stories that will have real life facts intertwined with loving and
                            adventures stories about these helpless animals. We believe kids are our future and can
                            surely accomplish anything they set their minds too. We also believe the that learning about
                            us while young sparks more ideas. Your compassion and imagination will someday lead to a
                            solution to save us!

        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>Why should you save us endangered animals? We will give you 3 reasons why!
            <ol>
                <li> If we go extinct then there will be a disruption in the food chain.</li>
                <li> Humans will have less food because we help keep the plant eaters under control so that there are
                    not to many of them but if we are gone they will eat all your vegetation.
                </li>
                <li> You depend on a healthy ecosystem but when we are endangered the ecosystem is thrown off balance
                    and it makes it harder for you to survive.
                </li>
            </ol>
            You do not know what ripple could be caused by one of us going extinct that could be too late to turn back
            and fix the ecosystem so save us before it is too late for you and us, for all of us. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>
                How can you save us? Here are some ways!
            <ol>
                <li> Teach siblings, parents, friends, and others about these animals so that they can also help!</li>
                <li> You could do what we did research! The more you know the more you can help by making sure you won't
                    do something that can harm these animals or their habitats!
                </li>
                <li> You could if you are an adult donate to these causes, this would help others have the things they
                    need to save these animals!
                </li>
                <li> You also could spread this website so that others can learn about these animals too! (If someone
                    gave you this link tell them thank you)!
                </li>
                <li> If you want you could tell others to do all of the above!</li>

                                <img src="img/Mina.png" alt="Mina">
                                <p>Hi, I am an African Wild Dog and my name is Mina. I live in a pack with my mother, my
                                    father, me and my two sisters(Melinie and Elle) and ten other wild dogs. Our leader
                                    is a female dog named Aliana. We are always hiding and running. We sometimes have to
                                    starve! We are losing our food because of the loss of their habitat. We are
                                    carnivores which means we eat meat. We hunt animals like antelopes on wildebeests.
                                    We don't see many packs in Africa. Hunters come and kill most of the packs or they
                                    lose their habitats. Mama always tells me that we have to believe in ourselves and
                                    keep going. We are one of the only species that care for the old, sick, and injured
                                    because for us family is family. There are only about 4,000 wild dogs in the wild.
                                    If we go extinct then there will be no dog species with four toes! We are one of a
                                    kind. We live for 10 to 13 years and weigh from 35 to 50 pounds! We are only found
                                    in Africa. We live in packs with an average of 10 members. 1 liter contains 16
                                    puppies! The pubs get to eat before the alpha. We also are not picky eaters. We eat
                                    almost anything! We are in competition for food with lions because we both eat just
                                    about the same things. We are one of the most endangered animals in the world!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There are about 4,000 wild dogs like me on average! To tell the truth I am really
                                    scared. What if a hunter got my pack? What if we could not find enough food and we
                                    starved to death? What if we caught one of the bad diseases?I want some miracle to
                                    save us! Mama says we have to be our own miracle. Mama is always correct. One day we
                                    were walking through the woods when I saw something shiny. “Stop”, I barked,
                                    everyone stopped and I told them to avoid the trap. They all listened and then we
                                    heard barking and voices, then a buzzing sound filled the air along with the scent
                                    of cut wood. We ran fast down the stretch of the forest around the city. We hurried
                                    to find another safe forest before it got dark. We finally reached another forest
                                    but it was dark outside so we would have to make a temporary den. Mama told me and
                                    my two sisters we had to have to take care of one another while they were gone. So
                                    we huddled around ourselves and cuddled while mamma and papa scouted with the rest
                                    of the pack. We were starting to get restless, so since we were all bored, we just
                                    talked. The adults came back and they found a patch of grass then they made the den.
                                    We cuddled up and slept. In two weeks we would leave this pack and start our own
                                    great packs! I would want to be my pack leader but mama says its hard work so I have
                                    to try hard. Aliana teaches us how to hunt in the morning and I am the best!

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Aliana says I will be the best pack member ever and I smile. She also pulls me aside
                                    and tells me I might become the pack leader. “Ding, help” Aliana cries out “I am
                                    stuck!”. I jump to see whats wrong and I see that it is only a net and I bite the
                                    net to save her.I am glad she is okay. We hurry back to the camp where my siblings
                                    ask if I am okay. I just nod. I thought about how close that was!. “Dinner”,
                                    Aliana’s voice rings through the trees. We bolt off in search of food and we spit up
                                    at the bend. Then around a tree I spot a wildebeest! I smile, Aliana will be proud.
                                    I bark to the pack which comes and we chase our prey. Finally the wildebeest got
                                    tired and slows down allowing us to advance. We capture our prey and feast! Aliana
                                    is very proud of me.


                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We then hear voices. We all expect to hear the buzz of the saw but this time we hear
                                    something different, something worse. “ Bam, bam, bam” the bullets are big and black
                                    flying over our head. We run. The hunters chase our pack aiming at us. Aliana barks
                                    and tells some of us to slack behind and go under their legs and run. She tells the
                                    rest of them to slack behind but go around them. We thankfully escape. The hunters
                                    are close on our tails, literally!. We go into a cave and they pass by. We run the
                                    other way, finally we reach home. I am more scared than ever. We go to bed but
                                    tonight I wake up, I crawl over to mama and Papa and snuggle in between them. I
                                    sleep peacefully for the rest of the night.In the morning we darted around our den
                                    and hid waiting for breakfast to visit us but none came. “We won’t get breakfast
                                    today” announced Aliana. “ Aww”.we all cried.


                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    ``Well” said mama “the hunters are killing all of them!” she continued” we won't
                                    survive long like this” Mama looked worried.I cuddled closer to her, she went on “
                                    this forest has no food, I think..” she did not look happy about what she was going
                                    to say. “ I think we have to…” she trailed off. I knew she could not finish the
                                    sentence but before I could finish it for her Aliana did “leave” she said. I know.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We left the house but shortly after we heard voices. “ Not again me and my two
                                    sisters whined and rolled on the ground. “Get up and stop whining” mama ordered.
                                    “Get up and run, get up and hide” she sounded mad but not at us at the hunters.
                                    “Wait I say “ they dont” want us, they want some other animal called..” a painted
                                    hunter, we are not painted and no animal here is painted, we should help them. I
                                    start to trot of but mama grabs my tail, “No” she says “ we are the painted hunters,
