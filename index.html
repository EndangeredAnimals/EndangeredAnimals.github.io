            <h4>Why Save Endangered Species?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>Why should you save us endangered animals? We will give you 3 reasons why!
            <ol>
                <li> If we go extinct then there will be a disruption in the food chain.</li>
                <li> Humans will have less food because we help keep the plant eaters under control so that there are
                    not to many of them but if we are gone they will eat all your vegetation.
                </li>
                <li> You depend on a healthy ecosystem but when we are endangered the ecosystem is thrown off balance,
                    and it makes it harder for you to survive. So please start working towards <h5>Ecosystem restoration.</h5>
                </li>
            </ol>
            You do not know what ripple could be caused by one of us going extinct that could be too late to turn back
            and fix the ecosystem so save us before it is too late for you and us, for all of us. </p>

            <h4>How to save Threatened Species and help with Species Recovery?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>
                How can you save us? Here are some ways!
            <ol>
                <li> Teach siblings, parents, friends, and others about these animals so that they understand the importance of <h5 style="display: initial">biodiversity loss</h5> and <h5 style="display: initial">wildlife conservation</h5>!</li>
                <li> You could do what we did research! The more you know the more you can help by making sure you won't
                    do something that can harm these animals or their habitats!
                </li>
                <li> You could if you are an adult donate to these causes, this would help others have the things they
                    need to save these animals!
                </li>
                <li> You also could spread this website so that others can learn about these animals too! (If someone
                    gave you this link tell them thank you)!
                </li>

            </ol>
            </p>
            <p> The more people are equipped with knowledge and compassion for the threatened species, the better will be the support system for these endangered species and chances for these endangered species to survive</p>

                                <p>Hi, I am an African Wild Dog and my name is Mina. I live in a pack with my mother, my
                                    father, me and my two sisters(Melinie and Elle) and ten other wild dogs. Our leader
                                    is a female dog named Aliana. We are always hiding and running. We sometimes have to
                                    starve! We are losing our food because of the loss of their habitat. We are
                                    carnivores which means we eat meat. We hunt animals like antelopes on wildebeests.
                                    We don't see many packs in Africa. Hunters come and kill most of the packs or they
                                    lose their habitats. Mama always tells me that we have to believe in ourselves and
                                    keep going. We are one of the only species that care for the old, sick, and injured
                                    because for us family is family. There are only about 4,000 wild dogs in the wild.
                                    If we go extinct then there will be no dog species with four toes! We are one of a
                                    kind. We live for 10 to 13 years and weigh from 35 to 50 pounds! We are only found
                                    in Africa. We live in packs with an average of 10 members. 1 liter contains 16
                                    puppies! The pubs get to eat before the alpha. We also are not picky eaters. We eat
                                    almost anything! We are in competition for food with lions because we both eat just
                                    about the same things. We are one of the most endangered animals in the world!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There are about 4,000 wild dogs like me on average! To tell the truth I am really
                                    scared. What if a hunter got my pack? What if we could not find enough food and we
                                    starved to death? What if we caught one of the bad diseases?I want some miracle to
                                    save us! Mama says we have to be our own miracle. Mama is always correct. One day we
                                    were walking through the woods when I saw something shiny. “Stop”, I barked,
                                    everyone stopped and I told them to avoid the trap. They all listened and then we
                                    heard barking and voices, then a buzzing sound filled the air along with the scent
                                    of cut wood. We ran fast down the stretch of the forest around the city. We hurried
                                    to find another safe forest before it got dark. We finally reached another forest
                                    but it was dark outside so we would have to make a temporary den. Mama told me and
                                    my two sisters we had to have to take care of one another while they were gone. So
                                    we huddled around ourselves and cuddled while mamma and papa scouted with the rest
                                    of the pack. We were starting to get restless, so since we were all bored, we just
                                    talked. The adults came back and they found a patch of grass then they made the den.
                                    We cuddled up and slept. In two weeks we would leave this pack and start our own
                                    great packs! I would want to be my pack leader but mama says its hard work so I have
                                    to try hard. Aliana teaches us how to hunt in the morning and I am the best!

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Aliana says I will be the best pack member ever and I smile. She also pulls me aside
                                    and tells me I might become the pack leader. “Ding, help” Aliana cries out “I am
                                    stuck!”. I jump to see whats wrong and I see that it is only a net and I bite the
                                    net to save her.I am glad she is okay. We hurry back to the camp where my siblings
                                    ask if I am okay. I just nod. I thought about how close that was!. “Dinner”,
                                    Aliana’s voice rings through the trees. We bolt off in search of food and we spit up
                                    at the bend. Then around a tree I spot a wildebeest! I smile, Aliana will be proud.
                                    I bark to the pack which comes and we chase our prey. Finally the wildebeest got
                                    tired and slows down allowing us to advance. We capture our prey and feast! Aliana
                                    is very proud of me.


                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We then hear voices. We all expect to hear the buzz of the saw but this time we hear
                                    something different, something worse. “ Bam, bam, bam” the bullets are big and black
                                    flying over our head. We run. The hunters chase our pack aiming at us. Aliana barks
                                    and tells some of us to slack behind and go under their legs and run. She tells the
                                    rest of them to slack behind but go around them. We thankfully escape. The hunters
                                    are close on our tails, literally!. We go into a cave and they pass by. We run the
                                    other way, finally we reach home. I am more scared than ever. We go to bed but
                                    tonight I wake up, I crawl over to mama and Papa and snuggle in between them. I
                                    sleep peacefully for the rest of the night.In the morning we darted around our den
                                    and hid waiting for breakfast to visit us but none came. “We won’t get breakfast
                                    today” announced Aliana. “ Aww”.we all cried.


                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    ``Well” said mama “the hunters are killing all of them!” she continued” we won't
                                    survive long like this” Mama looked worried.I cuddled closer to her, she went on “
                                    this forest has no food, I think..” she did not look happy about what she was going
                                    to say. “ I think we have to…” she trailed off. I knew she could not finish the
                                    sentence but before I could finish it for her Aliana did “leave” she said. I know.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We left the house but shortly after we heard voices. “ Not again me and my two
                                    sisters whined and rolled on the ground. “Get up and stop whining” mama ordered.
                                    “Get up and run, get up and hide” she sounded mad but not at us at the hunters.
                                    “Wait I say “ they dont” want us, they want some other animal called..” a painted
                                    hunter, we are not painted and no animal here is painted, we should help them. I
                                    start to trot of but mama grabs my tail, “No” she says “ we are the painted hunters,
                                    we just have to names" adds papa. “ Plus”, agrees mama, “Humans have no mercy on us,
                                    to them we dont look cute at all.” But they say all dogs are cute!My siblings are
                                    cute” Come my darling” says Aliana. Your mother is right” “Let me tell you a secret”
                                    says Aliana. “Only alpha dogs have puppies but your mother acted so much as your
                                    mother that she let you call her mom.” oh I say “ she loves me a lot and I dont want
                                    to leave my pack and start my own pack. I say “ You must” Aliana replies “Let's join
                                    the others. We ran with the pack and marked our territory and slept in the den. I
                                    crawled once again in between mama and papa. This time though mama sat up and curled
                                    around me snuggling me tight "Good night Mina”, she whispers softly into my ear.
                                    "You are my adorable". “My pack lived until the very end so did Aliana’s. But will
                                    our species? Will you save our species?</p>

                        Please email us if you have any questions or would like to learn more about a certain animal, and we will try to research about the animal and post a story and facts for you to read!</p>

                                <p>Every one of us crowded around Evelyn. Evelyn smiled at me, but I saw the pain in her eyes. Our gatherers came back and gave Evelyn her food, which was mostly fruit. My mom stayed close to Evelyn, trying to ease the pain. We knew Evelyn was strong, as she was one of our leaders, but we were still worried. My best hope was that it would be over soon, but for now, we would have to get her everything she needed.
                                </p><p>   Okay, let's backtrack a little. My name is Eliana. I am a bonobo; I live with my troop, which has 12 members, almost 13, I hope (Evelyn, me, and my mother included). I live in the Central Congolian Tropical Forests. It was really beautiful there, and there are still parts that are beautiful, but those won’t last. Humans are cutting down the forest’s trees. They are also killing Bonobos. They are capturing some, killing others for bushmeat, and removing our forests, which means less food. This is a risk we face every day, but nothing terrible has happened to my troop yet. For now, we are okay and are doing everything we can to survive and help each other thrive.
                            </p><p>     Now back from where we left off. I had been waiting by Evelyn's side the whole day, so I wandered away from the group when I heard a commotion. I ran back to Evelyn's side, and there in front of me was Evelyn, and in her arms was a baby girl! My mom was next to Evelyn, looking relieved and cheerful. Since my mom joined the troop, Evelyn and my mom had been close, Evelyn always looked after my mom, and as Evelyn was in labor, my mom looked after her. Everyone was happy, and we started to build the nest for tonight, when just as we finished, we heard the noise. “Bam, Bam, Bam,” gunfire, humans were shooting at us.
                            </p><p>       Big black bullets fell around us one nearly got mom's tail, another Evelyn’s newborn baby! Evelyn put the baby on her back, and the troop ran away as fast as we could. Finally, we lost them, and we arrived in a small clearing. No one was killed, but some were injured though not too badly. In other troops, it had been worse their members had been killed and captured. We tended to the wounded as we always did and started to relax. Parents played with their little ones while older kids rolled around and played tag, not unlike humans, I might add. I wish humans would see that we were really similar to them and that we had feelings and cared about the family and friends they were taking away from us. Come to think of it; I had not seen another troop in a while. Troops were dying out quickly, from habitat loss to starvation to poachers, and soon, there would be no bonobos left. Would humans care when we go extinct?
                            </p><p>        I got up and walked over to Evelyn. She was murmuring softly to her baby bonobo. “Colletta, that's your name; it means people of victory; you will be a victor; you will be safe.”
                            </p><p>         Slowly we went back to the nest we had made earlier; it would be safe now. Humans scarcely camped near our forests. We were relieved to find our nest okay, say for the stray bullets littering the floor. For dinner, though, we were tired and afraid, we scavenged as much as possible, but the trees to the north were gone, and it was getting dark, so no one wanted to risk setting off a trap. We climbed into the nest and fell asleep to our parents breathing.
                            </p><p>         I woke up to the sound of the adults talking, and loud footsteps down below the adults woke the rest of the troop up, and we climbed out of the tree. The sun was just beginning to rise, and I could hear the crickets chirping. We climbed down the tree fast, helping each other, and we darted into the forest, then hid and watched as the two-legged beasts known as humans sawed down our tree and the three more trees around it. We turned and walked away deeper into the forest, knowing we would need a miracle to save our kind, but it could be done. Let that miracle be you.
                                </p>

                                <p>Here are some fun facts about Bonobos!
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Bonobos and chimpanzees both share 98.7% of their DNA with humans.
                                    </li><li>     Though bonobos and chimpanzees look similar, bonobos are typically smaller and darker than chimpanzees.
                            </li><li>  Bonobos are very peaceful and led by females. Bonobos rarely fight when they are mad, instead they comfort each other.
                            </li><li>        Wild Bonobos live only south of the Congo river(the Democratic Republic of Congo) in African Rainforests.
                            </li><li>        The population numbers of bonobos are unknown though it is thought to have been declining for the last 30 years. Scientists think the population of the bonobos will keep going down for the next 45 to 55 years because of the bonobo’s low reproduction rates and other threats like poaching and habitat loss.
                            </li><li>        Bonobos look for food on the ground (for worms) and in the trees (for fruit).
                            </li><li>          Bonobos sleep in large groups making nests in trees.
                            </li><li>           They use tools to forage for food.
                            </li><li>         Bonobos give birth every 5 years.
                            </li><li>        Bonobos play some of the same games as humans.
                            </li><li>           Females usually have their first babies when they are 14 years old.
                            </li><li>           Females help when a member of the troop is giving birth, like midwives.
                            </li><li>              Bonobos care for their babies until they are four years old. Males stay with their moms their whole lives while females leave to join another troop.
                            </li><li>             Females take care of the kids while males give food and protection.
                            </li><li>             Bonobos are estimated to number (in the wild) about 10,000 to 20,000.
                            </li><li>            Deforestation and agriculture destroyed a large amount of bonobo’s forests, and even though it is illegal bonobos are poached and captured.

                           </li><li>              In 2021, two wild female bonobos adopted infants from other groups which is a rare behavior among wild animals!
                                     </li>      </ol>

                                </p><p>      I wake up; I am inside a little weird ball thing. I start to chew on it and finally escape. I am hungry, so I eat the weird thing. “Take that whatever you are,” I squeak. I look down at myself. I am a caterpillar. I am full. I don’t know what I am doing, but slowly I spin a pad of silk, attach it to my hind legs, and then, you won’t believe this, I walk out of my own skin. I eat the skin, of course. I don’t want anyone to see it. Then I slowly started munching on the milkweed that I had been on top of. Milkweed is good. Life is amazing. “I need a name. Something to call me.” I squeak. I keep eating and thinking, and finally, I decide, “Anika! I want to be named Anika. It's a pretty unique name, and I like it very much. It’s my name now!” I smile to myself. I slowly crawl to the next leaf and nibble on it. That's when I see it. To the north of me are milkweed plants behind a fence; they are far enough that I am safe, but I can see that a weird creature is spraying something on the plants, and that's when I realize the truth.
                            </p><p>       The stuff that they are spraying? If a caterpillar eats that milkweed, it will die. You can tell by the way the plants look … wrong and how there are caterpillars there, unmoving … just there. “It is going to be okay, Anika. Just watch which milkweed you eat, and you will be okay”.  I squeak to myself.
                            </p><p>      So my life goes on, and I stick to my milkweed plant. Every day I do the same thing, I would be bored, but I keep myself entertained by telling myself jokes and talking to myself. I do the weird thing where I step out of my skin 5 times, and each time I am bigger! I like doing fun things! Finally, on the 18th day, I sing to myself, “I eat, then I sleep, then it goes on repeat,” I take a bite of the leaf and keep singing, “But today that's all going to change, hooray,”  I climb of my host plant sad to let it go but then remember it will be safer. “I am going to do something fun,” I sing. I find another milkweed plant, check if it is safe by looking around for the giant, then try the leaf. It tastes as good as ever! I climbed up to a nice sturdy leaf, and then I slowly attached my back legs to the leaf and then curled into a kind of J shape with my body.
                            </p><p>      1 Week Later:
                            </p><p>      I shake in my cocoon, and out I go; I am on the clear thing I was just inside. I unfurl my wings. “Am I still Anika? Or someone else? Well … I like Anika, so I think I will stick with her.” I chirp. I smile; I know one thing for sure. I have wings! Beautiful orange wings with black veins and white spots. “I butterfly!” I chirp “Get it? Because I better fly, I butterfly?”. Yes, I am definitely Anika; I even still talk to myself; I just look different. I let my wings get ready then I take off flying through the morning air, the wind rustling the trees. I am not the only one. There are more of us. I hear one of them talking about migrating. I think I might go with them. I want to migrate to Mexico! Days pass, and I drink the sweet nectar from all kinds of plants, being careful not to eat or drink anything around the human hideout; others are not so lucky, and it is not their fault, it is the humans. There are few of us left by the time we migrate. I learn the name of what they are spraying; pesticides and chemicals; these are the things killing my kind. I worry a lot about our safety, but I keep talking to myself and telling jokes. I visit my host plant once or twice for the fun of it, but other than that, I don’t really think much about my past. I have lots of fun in the day, flitting from flower to flower, but rarely communicating with other butterflies. On the final day of the trip, we set off for Mexico; we flew early, and it took an overall 2 months, but it was a wonderful experience until I heard two butterflies behind me talking, saying it was a shame. They said there used to be around 10 million monarch butterflies only 41 years ago, but now there are scarcely 2,000 in the world. It may sound like a big number, but it is not.
                            </p><p>      Think about it, when was the last time you saw a monarch butterfly? When was the last time you saw a monarch butterfly in the wild? All of us will be gone soon. My name is Anika, and I am telling you, all of you kids out there; you have to do something, anything before it is too late.

                                <p>Here are some fun facts about Monarch butterflies!
                                <ol>
                                <li>Monarch butterfly's bright colors warn predators saying they are “poisonous”
                            </li><li>  Butterflies get their poison from milkweed (the only plant caterpillars eat).
                            </li><li>     Animals that eat monarchs don’t die, but they do get sick, which makes them want to avoid monarchs in the future.
                            </li><li>   Milkweed is the only plant on which monarch butterflies will lay their eggs on, but millions of acres of milkweed have been destroyed.
                            </li><li>   Monarch caterpillars can eat a whole milkweed leaf in five minutes or less, and they eat 200 times their weight of milkweed!
                            </li><li>   Monarch butterflies complete a migration each year. These butterflies leave North America and travel to Mexico or California (a distance of nearly 2,500 miles)
                            </li><li>   Monarchs return to the same forests every year, and some can even find the same tree their ancestors landed on.
                            </li><li>   Around the end of winter, the butterflies in Mexico and California mate, and the females go north, leaving eggs on milkweed while the males die.
                            </li><li>   Monarchs live in all of America, Australia, some many Pacific Islands, India, and Western Europe.
                            </li><li>   The Monarch butterfly is the state insect of Texas, Minnesota, Idaho, Illinois, and Alabama and the state butterfly of Vermont and West Virginia.
                            </li><li>   Monarch butterfly's scientific name is the Danaus plexippus which translates to sleepy transformation in greek. This name was given to it due to the fact that is can change into a butterfly while asleep.
                            </li><li>   Males have black dots along the “veins” of their wings, and they are slightly bigger than females.
                            </li><li>   Males attract females with scent glands in their hind wings.
                            </li><li>   Adult monarchs live for only four to five weeks.
                            </li><li>   The word chrysalis is from the Greek word “chrysos” meaning gold. There are gold spots on the monarch's chrysalises; they are from the “carotenoid pigment” in the milkweed they eat.
                            </li><li>   A female monarch butterfly can lay from 300 to 500 eggs in a two to five-week span!
                            </li><li>   Monarch caterpillars eat their eggshells.
                            </li><li>   Monarchs make a pad of silk, attach it to their hind legs, and then walks out of their skin (It does this to grow). Then it eats the skin so as not to show any trace of it being there. It does this five times in its lifetime.
                            </li><li>    These caterpillars can grow 2,700 times their original weight in the span of their 10 to 14-day caterpillar stage.
                           </li><li>   The name of a group of butterflies is called a flutter.
                            </li><li>   Pesticides and other chemicals people use while farming crops have killed milkweed as well as butterflies.
                            </li><li>   Monarchs are very sensitive to temperature and weather changes, so climate change is also affecting them a lot.
                            </li><li>  <h4> You can help by planting milkweed in your yard.</h4>
